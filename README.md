# Go Radio Recorder
The goals of this project are 
 - [ ] to have a recorder for radio stations via their Livestream in a similar way to [Deutschlandradio Recorder](https://deutschlandradio.de/erste-schritte.440.de.html)
 - [ ] program recordings for the future and waking the pc from standby on start
 - [ ] remote recorders -> Web gui
 - [ ] have a preview for upcoming programmes, the ability to program recurring programmes

Currently only two german stations are supported. Support will be extended in the future.

At this point there aren't any time zone considerations yet (and it will stay like that for some time). If you move to a different time zone with recorders preset, or are in a different time zone than the radio station, things will be weird.

This program is currently in a Pre-Alpha state. Don't use it unless you know exactly what you are doing!
